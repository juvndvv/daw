            <h2> THE GREAT MIGRATION </h2>
        </header>
        <p>One of the most spectacular and impressive natural phenomena in the world that one cannot miss. It all happens in the big <a href="#">African National Parks</a>. Every year, up to one and a half million white bearded wildebeests, 250,000 Burchell zebras and half a million Thomson gazelles walk through the <em>Serengeti-Mara</em> complex along a cyclical march covering about 2,700 kilometres.</p>

            <h2>Massai Mara National Reserve </h2>
        </header>
        <p><span><a href="#">The Massai Mara National Reserve </a>, located in southern Kenya </span> is one of the only sites still exhibiting concentrations of animals reminiscent of the days of the great white hunters, when all of East Africa was an immense hunting preserve. The reserve is not fenced in, so animals and visitors find a free way to move at their whim. There are no limits, even at national borders. Animals reach beyond <span><a href="#">Serengeti National Park</a> in northern Tanzania</span>. This is what is known as the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, a 25,000 km² piece of Africa. </p>
        <p>
            The movements of the fauna are highly conditioned by the climate. The vast plains of the <em class="special">Serengeti</em>, receive insufficient rainfall to have provisions all year round. The wettest area of the ecosystem is the region of <em class="special">Masai Mara</em>, with rainfall from November to June. Thus, Masai Mara is a powerful magnet for large herds in search of fresh pastures, and this is the spark that triggers <a href="#">the great migration </a> mainly of wildebeests, zebras and gazelles.

                    <p>The timing and route that’s well-known—from the southern <span>S</span>erengeti through the
                        Western Corridor up to the <span>M</span>aasai <span>M</span>ara then back to the start through
                        the Loliondo and Lobo area—is more of an estimation than a reliable roadmap.</p>
                        <p>Still, there are some general guidelines for when and where to visit. </p>
